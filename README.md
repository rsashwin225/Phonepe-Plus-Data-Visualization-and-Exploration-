# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

## Introduction

This project is a Streamlit web application built to explore and visualize digital payment trends in India using the PhonePe Pulse dataset. The app allows users to analyze transactions and user statistics across states, districts, years, quarters, and transaction categories.

By using interactive charts and maps, the dashboard helps identify patterns, track adoption of UPI payments, and gain insights that are useful for the fintech industry.
